This distribution contains symlinks, which may be inconvenient if you
are trying to run it out of git on Windows.  I have provided a script
which will convert the git symlinks (which appear as just text files 
with the target as the content on MSWin32) into honest windows symbolic
links using the mklink command.  You will need administrator privileges:

perl win32/fixlinks.pl

It may not work properly if you are using the same checkout for both
MSWin32 and cygwin.
